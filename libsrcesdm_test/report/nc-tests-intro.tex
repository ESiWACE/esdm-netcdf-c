\section{Introduction}

The directory \textbf{nc\_test4} has originally 104 tests.
The tests were classified according to their output using NetCDF.
Basically, we expect that all benchmarks run with NetCDF successfully but some tests turned out to be non-functional.
There are four categories for the tests:

\begin{description}

\item[Not Tested] It means the test was not tested.
This category usually represents tests that are too long to run or tests that demand a large amount of memory or processing.

\item[Not Building] It means it was not possible to compile the test.

\item[Not Running] It means the test compiles, but there is something wrong when the test runs and the expected output is not produced.

\item[Working] It means the test compiles, runs and produces the expected output.

\end{description}
